## SpaceX Data Analysis
# Introduction
This project is aimed at analyzing the data from all SpaceX launches using various data analysis techniques. The goal is to gain insights into SpaceX's launch history and success rates, as well as to explore correlations between different variables such as payload mass, orbit type, and launch outcome.

# Data
The data used for this project was obtained from SpaceX's official API. The dataset includes information on all SpaceX launches from 2006 to the present.

# Methodology
The project was completed using Python and various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, and then various data analysis techniques were applied to analyze the data.

# Results
The project analyzed SpaceX's launch history and success rates using various visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts. The results revealed interesting insights about the success rates of different types of launches, as well as the impact of payload mass and orbit type on launch outcome.

# Conclusion
The project successfully analyzed the data from all SpaceX launches using various data analysis techniques. The results revealed insights into SpaceX's launch history and success rates, as well as correlations between different variables such as payload mass, orbit type, and launch outcome. This project could be improved by incorporating additional features or data sources to gain more insights from the data.

# Usage
The project can be run by opening the "spacex.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook and running the code cells in order. The required packages can be installed by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal.
